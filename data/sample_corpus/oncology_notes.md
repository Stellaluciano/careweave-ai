# Oncology Biomarker Notes
Biomarkers can indicate disease subtype, likely prognosis, and response to targeted therapy. In clinical operations, biomarker-driven pathways help prioritize treatment options and trial matching.

# Trial Design
Randomized controlled clinical trials reduce selection bias by assigning participants to intervention groups using chance. Blinding and predefined endpoints improve reliability of results.
